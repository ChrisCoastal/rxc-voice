    <h4>Hi, {{ delegate_email }}</h4>
    <p>Welcome to RxC Voice! We want to invite you to participate in a dry run of the RxC Voice democratic process. The purpose of the dry run is to work out bugs in the application and its underlying mechanism design before we ask the broader community to participate in the beta launch in May.</p>
    <p>Please use the link below to create an account and participate.</p>

    <p>This dry run is moot--we won’t use the outcome for anything other than improving RxC Voice. The participants in the dry run will conduct a mock democratic process to answer the following question: “What activities should the RadicalxChange Foundation prioritize in 2021-2022?” Once again, this is merely a test--the results will not be binding. As you participate, you can refer to the guide below for helpful information about the process. If you have any further questions, don't hesitate to reach out to us at voice@radicalxchange.org.</p>
    <p>The RxC Voice democratic process is modular—by default, the procedure includes three fundamental stages: 1) voice credit delegation, 2) deliberation, and 3) election.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <h3 class="stage-header">Delegation from April 19th to 20th:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span>Like you, each participant (henceforth called “delegate”) receives 99 voice credits upon initializing the process. You will use these voice credits to vote in the Election stage--but that comes later on.</span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>During the Delegation Stage, you have the option to transfer any number of your voice credits to other delegates.</span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>You also have the option to send voice credits by email to someone who is not yet on the delegates’ list.</span>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <span>Note: To keep the dry run private, you may only invite “new” people from
                  <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QLTC4aqvICnb3_YuUJvD9UQBQdEQqZev5MRdK8lEHnI/edit?usp=sharing"
                  >this list.
                  </a> (Please check it out and do so because we need your help to test this feature).
                </span>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>There are two crucial “twists” to the Delegation Stage--it’s essential to keep both in mind as you consider your decisions about transferring credits:</span>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <span>To participate in subsequent stages (including voting in the Election Stage), a delegate must have at least 25 voice credits. Don’t give away too many!</span>
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>A pool of 2,097 voice credits will match your transfers according to the
                  <a href="https://www.radicalxchange.org/concepts/quadratic-funding/"
                  >Quadratic Funding
                  </a> formula.
                </span>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3 class="stage-header">Deliberation from April 21 to 23:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span>The Deliberation Stage helps design the final election ballot.</span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>The delegates will all participate in a
              <a href="https://pol.is/home"
              >Polis conversation
              </a> about the strategic priorities of the RxC Foundation.
            </span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>This is your opportunity to directly contribute items to the ballot by submitting “comments.” You may also submit comments that express any ideas, feelings, or principles that you feel are relevant to the conversation.</span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>You also have the opportunity to “agree” or “disagree” with other delegates’ comments. This gives us detailed information about where there is consensus and where there is disagreement.</span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>At the end of the Deliberation Stage, the Foundation will analyze the results of the conversation and curate the delegates’ suggestions into a coherent list of voting items for the election. The Foundation will publish a statement explaining how that list reflects the delegates’ contributions in the Deliberation Stage.</span>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3 class="stage-header">Election from April 24 to 25:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span>In this stage, the delegates express which ballot options they like best using
              <a href="https://www.radicalxchange.org/concepts/quadratic-voting/"
              >Quadratic Voting
              </a>.
            </span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>An essential option on the ballot will be "Ballot Ratification."</span>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <span>With this particular ballot item, you can express whether or not you feel that the ballot fairly and accurately represents the delegates’ contributions in the Deliberation Stage.</span>
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>At the end of the Election, if the sum of effective votes for the Ballot Ratification option is less than zero, the results of the Election are nullified and a new ballot must be curated and voted on--so make sure you place a couple of voice credits toward supporting or opposing the Ballot Ratification option, depending on your satisfaction with the ballot curation.</span>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>If the ballot gets approved, the election results are published according to the quadratic voting rules, i.e., the options are ranked by the number of effective votes they receive.</span>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
