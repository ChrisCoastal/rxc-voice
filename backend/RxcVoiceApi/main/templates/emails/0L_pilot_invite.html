    <h4>Hi, {{ delegate_email }}</h4>

    <p>By way of background, the RxC Voice procedure includes three democratic steps: 1) voice credit delegation, 2) deliberation, and 3) election.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <h3 class="stage-header">Delegation from September 29th to October 4th</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span>Like you, each participant (henceforth called “delegate”) receives 99 voice credits upon initializing the process. You will use these voice credits to vote in the Election stage--but that comes later on.</span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>During the Delegation Stage, you have the option to transfer any number of your voice credits to other delegates.</span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>You also have the option to send voice credits by email to someone who is not yet on the delegates’ list.</span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>There are two crucial “twists” to the Delegation Stage--it’s essential to keep both in mind as you consider your decisions about transferring credits:</span>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <span>A delegate must have at least 25 voice credits to participate in the subsequent stages of the process, Deliberation and Election. Don't give away too many of your voice credits!</span>
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>A pool of voice credits will match your transfers according to the
                  <a href="https://www.radicalxchange.org/concepts/quadratic-funding/"
                  >Quadratic Funding
                  </a> formula.
                </span>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3 class="stage-header">Deliberation from October 4th to 6th</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span>The Deliberation Stage helps design the final election ballot.</span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>The delegates will all participate in a
              <a href="https://pol.is/home"
              >Polis conversation.
              </a>
            </span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>This is your opportunity to directly contribute items to the ballot by submitting “comments.” You may also submit comments that express any ideas, feelings, or principles that you feel are relevant to the conversation.</span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>You also have the opportunity to “agree” or “disagree” with other delegates’ comments. This gives us detailed information about where there is consensus and where there is disagreement.</span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>At the end of the Deliberation Stage, we will analyze the results of the conversation and curate the delegates’ suggestions into a coherent list of voting items for the election. We will publish a statement explaining how that list reflects the delegates’ contributions in the Deliberation Stage.</span>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3 class="stage-header">Election from October 6th to 8th</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span>In this stage, the delegates express which ballot options they like best using
              <a href="https://www.radicalxchange.org/concepts/quadratic-voting/"
              >Quadratic Voting
              </a>.
            </span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>An essential option on the ballot will be "Ballot Ratification."</span>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <span>With this particular ballot item, you can express whether or not you feel that the ballot fairly and accurately represents the delegates’ contributions in the Deliberation Stage.</span>
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>At the end of the Election, if the sum of effective votes for the Ballot Ratification option is less than zero, the results of the Election are nullified and a new ballot must be curated and voted on--so make sure you place a couple of voice credits toward supporting or opposing the Ballot Ratification option, depending on your satisfaction with the ballot curation.</span>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>If the ballot gets approved, we publish the Quadratic Voting results ranking the priorities by the sum of their effective votes.</span>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
